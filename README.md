Quark
=====

A game of matter

Quark is a physics themed, lightweight card game by Brian Mayer (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182430/quark)

This repo contains an implementation/redesign of this game. It follows the same rules,
but the cards have been redesigned and some extra information and flavour text was added.

You can download the following pdf files to print the game elements. All pdfs are made for double-sided printing (front and back alternate)

* Quark_rule_book.pdf : The rules of quark. This pdf is in an A5 booklet format; when printed on A4 pages (double sided) you can fold them in the moddle to get a booklet.
If you want to print differently, the libreoffice writer file is also available in the repo (Quark_rule_book.odt)
* Quark_short_rules.pdf : short, schematised version of the rules. Prints on 1 A4 paper (2 "columns", or A5 pages)
* quark-game.pdf : all cards and tokens
* atomtrack.pdf : The atomtrack page comes in a separate pdf as it is not doublesided

All nandeck code, Excel file with card lists and info, and design elements are available for people wanting to translate or re-redesign
